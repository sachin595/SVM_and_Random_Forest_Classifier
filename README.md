# SVM_and_Random_Forest_Classifier
## In this project we are using real life lung cancer data and implementing it on two machine learning models “Support Vector Machine” and “Random Forest”. We will be doing pre-processing of data and then making data into numerical form which will be taken by these models. After that we will be evaluating the model by using five evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, and AUC (area under curve of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve).
